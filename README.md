# Advanced-NoContact-Doorbell
An advanced contactless doorbell system which allows a person to ring a doorbell without direct contact and curbs the spread of COVID-19 virus. The doorbell also detects the type of newcomer waiting outside.

# About
COVID-19 has wrecked havoc in all spheres of life, in every part of the world. One of the worst affected country is India. COVID-19 spreads mainly by droplets produced as a result of coughing or sneezing of a COVID-19 infected person. The droplets can survive for days on surfaces and clothes. Therefore, touching any infected surface or cloth and then touching oneâ€™s mouth, nose or eyes can transmit the disease. As precautionary measures, contactless methods are being developed for our day to day activities to curb the growth of the virus. One such essential activity is ringing a doorbell. Be it the cleaner, a delivery personnel, a salesman or some relative - they have to press the doorbell in order to ring it, which leaves a chance of contracting the virus.

As a remedy to this problem, we have come up with the idea of an advanced no-contact doorbell. In contrary to a simple no-contact doorbell, this bell can detect the type of person who rang the bell. Here's how it works - a person who wishes to ring the doorbell, signals towards the webcam fitted outside, with his hand and palm, and makes the following signs - 1 for relative , 2 for delivery personnel , 3 for cleaner , 4 for newspaper and 5 for salesman . There is a low cost, credit card sized computer (eg. Raspberry Pi) connected to the webcam, which is capable of running Python scripts. There is a small digital screen installed outside which shows the position of the newcomers hand in realtime to them, so that they can place their hands properly for the webcam to detect. It also works as an instruction board to them. Finally, after the signage is detected, a particular alarm is played by a speaker connected to the computer, which alarms the insiders of a newcomer.

So the system not only works as a no-contact doorbell, but also specifies the kind of newcomer waiting outside. Hence, "advanced" no contact doorbell. The cost of setting up and regulating such a system maybe greater then a regular ordinary doorbell, but the idea to stay safe and keep others safe from contamination should be kept in mind. We must aim to try out contactless ways to complete our essential day-to-day works. That way, we keep ourselves, our family and others safe from the virus.
